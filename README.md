# Sales-Analysis
The data was provided by AQSkill for analysis to provide insights.

### QUESTIONS

- Who are the top valuable customers?

- Which is the top loss-making product?

- Which is the top discounted item?

- Which category of products accounts for most sales?

- Which segment of customers accounts for most sales?

- What month of the year has the highest sales?

### PROCESS

Data from a company retailing various office products was used to create a sales dashboard. The analysis aimed to answer the questions provided.

I used the sales data from 2016 to 2019 to create pivot tables, which summarized total revenue, total number of products sold, total profit, and total discount.

I then created charts and cards on the dashboard.

Finally, I  added filters to the dashboard to make it interactive. The filters include year, region, and ship mode.

### FINDINGS

1.	The top profitable customers vary annually but overall Tamara Chand was first.
2.	The Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head was the top most loss-making product over the years.
3.	Binders are the most discounted items at $156 per item.
4.	Technology products account for 37% of sales with a revenue of $836,154 of the total $2,297,201.
5.	The consumer segment leads the revenue share at $134,119.
6.	November is the peak sales month with $352,000 in revenue, however this varies per year region and ship mode.
