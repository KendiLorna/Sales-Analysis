# Sales-Analysis
Company sales data in Excel was used for the analysis.

### DATA SOURCE

AQSkill provided the data for analysis to provide insights in an Excel dashboard.

### QUESTIONS

- Who are the top five valuable customers?

- Which are the five top loss-making products?

- Which are the top five discounted items?

- Which category of products accounts for most sales?

- Which segment of customers accounts for most sales?

- What month of the year has the highest sales?

### PROCESS

Data from a company retailing various office products created a sales dashboardâ€”the analysis aimed to answer the questions provided.

The data was clean- confirmed through checks for duplicates, missing values, and nulls.

I used the sales data from 2016 to 2019 to create pivot tables, which summarized total revenue, total number of products sold, total profit, and total discount.

I then created charts and cards on the dashboard.

Finally, I  added filters to the dashboard to make it interactive. The filters include year, region, and ship mode.
